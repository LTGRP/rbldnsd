This is rbldnsd.

Main changes from the original source:

1. Added CMake build system
2. Added LTO support when compiling
3. Better portability
4. Switched to semver versioning
5. Added hashed backend (dnhash) that uses less CPU but doesn't support wildcards/negations

TODO:

1. Rate limits using leaky bucket model
2. Hyperscan based regexp backend
3. Multiprocessing using SO_REUSEPORT and eBPF filters to optimise UDP flows
4. Better documentation
